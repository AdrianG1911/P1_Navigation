### The Network
The network has an input size of 37 and an output size of 4, it has 2 hidden layers both of which have 64 nodes. Relu is used as the activation function for the hidden layers, the output layer is linear.


```python
# Make neural network

### Learning Algorithm

**Type of reinforcement learning algorithm**

The learning algorithm uses a Double DQN method along with randomly sampled experience replay in order to learn. The difference between Double DQN and fixed Q targets is that the target network does not choose the best actions for the next state and evaluate those actions for the Q-target, instead the local network chooses the actions and the target network evaluates the value of those actions.


**Hyper parameters**

The target network is slowely updated with TAU to resemble the local network but be different enough to prevent Q values from becoming too large. The BUFFER_SIZE is the size of the replay buffer, BATCH_SIZE is how many experiences are taken from the replay buffer to learn each time, GAMMA is the discount factor to prioritize imediet rewards more, LR is the learning rate, UPDATE_EVERY is used to spread out the learning every few time steps.



```python
# Make agent that can learn

BUFFER_SIZE = int(1e5)  # replay buffer size
BATCH_SIZE = 64         # minibatch size
GAMMA = 0.99            # discount factor
TAU = 1e-3              # for soft update of target parameters
LR = 5e-4               # learning rate 
UPDATE_EVERY = 4        # how often to update the network

### Ideas for Improving the Agent's Performance

There are many ways to improve the agent's performance.
* Using a larger network:
    the simplest way is to increase the size and number of hidden layers in the neural network. 

* Implementing prioritized experience replay: prioritized experience replay will allow the agent to learn from important experiences more reliably than normal random experience replay.

* Tweeking the hyperparameters: testing different combinations of values for hyperparameters like TAU, the learning rate or BATCH_SIZE in order to create an agent that learns faster.
